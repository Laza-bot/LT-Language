It is **faster than Python** because some parts are written in pure Assembly.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Simple Syntax** – Inspired by Go, Python, and BASIC
- 🎨 **Built-in Graphics Library** – Similar to Turtle  
- 🔄 **Control Structures** – If statements, loops, and functions  
- ➕ **Mathematical Operations** – Arithmetic, comparisons, logical operators  
- 📦 **Variable Handling** – Dynamic typing for flexibility  
- 📜 **List Support** – Arrays and collections  
- 🏗 **Function Definitions** – With optional parameters  
- 📏 **Structured Indentation** – For readability
